## Overview & Learning Goals
For our mod 1 paired project, we will build a webpage that randomly generates motivational posters with quotes. It should, eventually, also allow user a user save their own posters as well.

We will develop our skills and understanding in JS functionality and changing webpage views.

Our estimated schedule is as follows:

- **7/07-08/2020**
- **7/09-10/2020**
- **7/11-12/2020**
- **7/13-14/2020**

## Progression

7/7: Gave day one deliverables to instructors and reviewed the project scope. Created DTR version one.

7/8: Reviewed DOM, HTML connections. Discussed key functions that might be necessary for the project.

7/9: Fixed GitHub remote repo connection. Initial commit was created to load poster when window is refreshed with the displayCurrentPoster function. We created the functionality for the "show another random poster button". We then pushed these updates to our master branch. We then created the showFormView, showSavedPostersView, and sendToMainPage functions.
